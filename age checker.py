#this is a simple age checker script
age = int(input('Enter your age:'))
if age < 18:
    print('sorry, you are not eligible to vote')#if the user's age is less than 18, it prints this
else:
    print('you are eligible to vote')#if user's age is 18 or more, it prints this
#### i hope you  understand  this code and how it works    '''i only used if and else statement because there is no other criteria that needs to be checked'''
